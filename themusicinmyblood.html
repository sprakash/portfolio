		<p class="block-text"> The Music In My Blood crosses the boundaries of time and space to bring together Prema and Walter, two people bound by their love of Indian music.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="block-text">In 1934, Jewish Czech musicologist Walter Kaufmann (1907 - 1984) fled from the Nazis and temporarily resettled in India where he fell in love with the music of his new home land. He became a noted scholar and composer of Asian music and even composed a signature theme song for All India Radio that is still played today.  Meanwhile, Prema is born in India to parents from a musical dynasty. When she flees to Brooklyn in the 1980's to pursue a degree in history, Prema discovers the writings of Dr. Kaufmann.  Soon, the unlikely pair begin to converse across time and space about music, tradition, culture and heritage.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="block-text">I began work on this play when I started to learn Indian classical music with my guru Sandip Bhattacharjee. I wanted to explore musical unions between eastern and western music disciplines. There is a moment at the start of the play, Dr. Kaufmann is conducting the orchestra and the melody is intercepted by the "sa re ga ma" solfege of Indian classical music sung by a young singer. Dr. Kaufmann was influened heavily by Indian music which became the basis of his scholarly work during his eleven year stay in India. </p>
		<br/>
		<em class="block-text">After writing the first iteration that was performed in 2016, I collaborated with Sonalee Hardikar for the future revisions of the play.</em>

			<p>I conceptualized, shot and edited the Spotlight series where each cast (we were working with a double cast) and production team member spoke of their involvement in the play and a specific aspects such as use of Natyashastra (indian scripture on theatre) in rehearsals, working with live music, the role of women in evolution of Indian classical music, along with challenges of being an immigrant performer with stories to tell that do not fall into <br/>the mainstream theatre in the United States.</p>

<p>Travelled to Florida to meet 94 year old Dr. William Lazer, brother-in-law to Dr. Walter Kaufmann and his daughter Simon Lazer. I learned much a lot about the genius, musician, humanitarian and unsung hero Dr. Kaufmann who was featured as a character in the play. </p>
