							<p class="block-text">	a "choose your own adventure" style short film created as an entry for The Challenge of Diversity competition by Interlude (now acquired by eKo),  Games for Change and Tribeca Film Festival.  The viewer has the opportunity to audition 5 actresses for the same role of Kaos, sidekick to the superhero in the superhero movie “Bang & Kaos”. The viewer is a casting director and decides who gets called back. The theme was diversity in casting.  I picked actresses of different ethnicities and using Interlude’s (now acquired by eKo) platform created an experience where the user can make a decision to cast the role.   Through this work I addressed my own challenges as an actor in the audition room as a person of color.</p>
							<em>I developed the concept, served as director, editor and producer.</em>

									Two female comedians have been formed into a team. The establishment has laid down the rules, only one of the two is allowed to face the audience and perform the jokes, the other must work behind the scenes. Together they must challenge both the establishment and their own beliefs on talent, beauty and being an artist. Funny Faces was a result of a 72 hour film shootout competition, a worldwide contest that is conducted annually by Asian American Film Lab in New York City, where the theme was “Two Faces”. Funny Faces placed in the top ten.

							<p class="block-text">My first short “Three Dates” was about an ethnically ambiguous man facing judgement from his dates when they discover his true ethnicity. I used comedy to point at possible stereotypes attached to particular ethnicities. Three Dates, was screened at the 2013 New York Indian Film Festival. This short film led to the creation of Random Fox Productions.</p>
