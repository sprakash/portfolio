									Two female comedians work well as a team. The establishment has laid down the rules, only one of the two is allowed to perform the jokes, the other must work behind the scenes. Together they must challenge both the establishment and their own beliefs on talent, beauty and being an artist. Funny Faces was a result of a 72 hour film shootout competition, a worldwide contest that is conducted annually by Asian American Film Lab in New York City, where the theme was “Look Deeper”. Funny Faces placed in the top ten.
