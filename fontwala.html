			<span>about the work</span>
			<p>Fontwala is a story inspired by the life and work of Rajeev Prakash Khare a typographer, font
				designer
				and calligrapher of Indian scripts. He designed one of the first keyboards The Anglo Nagari
				Keyboard
				that allowed for Indian scripts to be typed on a Latin based keyboard. Shubhra Prakash, his niece
				and
				New York based theatre artist began interviewing him in 2017 to write this story of innovation. The
				story has become a solo theatre play in English, an ensemble play in Hindi, a digital exhibiton and
				is
				on its way to become a documentary. All these forms pose three questions: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>what remains of an artist who becomes an entrepreneur ?</li>
				<li>what remains of the aesthetic of a language digitized ?</li>
				<li>what remains of a dream of returning to one’s homeland to live in after 20 years in the west ?
				</li>

				<img src="images/fontwala/make2.webp" />
				<p>Rajeev Prakash Khare is a calligrapher and font design expert who founded VSOFT, one of the first
					software companies in the 90s to produce Indian language fonts. He started in his younger years by
					painting election ads on the walls of his neighborhood in Allahabad (now Prayag Raj) and through his
					education in Benaras
					Hindu University (BFA) to IIT Bombay IDC he never thought he would create a software for Hindi
					typing on the computer keyboard. Neither did he know then that typefaces designed by him would be
					used on a mass scale by publishing houses,
					media, film industry and government offices in India. <a href="http://rajeevfontwala.com">Visit

		<h1>DIGITAL EXHIBITION : "Fontwala, Stone to mobile, what remains ?"</h1>
		<quote></quote>

		<div class="project-container">
			<div class="content-area">


				<p>In December 2018, I moved to India to research my next play, Fontwala. Early 2017 I began
					interviewing Rajeev Prakash Khare, a designer and typographer of Indian letterforms, mainly
					Devanagari. He designed the ANGLO NAGARI KEYBOARD one of the first softwares that could type Hindi
					and other Indian languages on the Computer via their program APS. As Microsoft entered the market
					with Windows XP loaded with free fonts for Indian languages, Khare's company shut down overnight.
					The story is a man's passion for his language and script and digitization of "complex" scripts.
					During the research I proposed a digital art exhibition at New Delhi's Kaleidoscope Digital Art. I
					shot, edited, animated and produced the exhibition that ran for three weeks in Aug 2019. We
					presented our work in seven video screens as well as weekly Devanagari calligraphy workshops for the
					attendees. After the exhibition we also participated with Delhi Street Art to create street art
					based on Devanagari script.</p>
