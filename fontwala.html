<p>In December 2018, I moved to India to research my next play, Fontwala. Early 2017 I began interviewing Rajeev Prakash Khare, a designer and typographer of Indian letterforms, mainly Devanagari. He founded one of the early software companies (VSOFT) that could type Hindi and other Indian languages on the Computer via their program APS. As Microsoft entered the market with Windows XP loaded with free fonts for Indian languages, Khare's company shut down overnight. The story is a man's passion for his language and script, commodification and 	how Devanagari and it's aesthetic is surviving in current digital atmosphere.  During the research I proposed a digital art exhibition at New Delhi's Kaleidoscope Digital Art. I shot, edited, animated and produced the exhibition that ran for three weeks in Aug 2019. We presented our work in seven video screens as well as weekly Devanagari calligraphy workshops for the attendees. After the exhibition we also participated with Delhi Street Art to create street art based on Devanagari script.</p>
